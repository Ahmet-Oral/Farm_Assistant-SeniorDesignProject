## Project Overview
Farm Assistant is a mobile application for phones with Android OS. It is designed to help users with their planning 
and organization for agricultural and animal-related work. It can be used by anyone who owns a field or animals. The 
application helps users to keep track of their assets by allowing them to transfer their fields or animals to the 
program with a dynamic interface that users can modify its features and create freely. 

The application also has a built-in calendar system which can be used to plan ahead by creating tasks. The tasks are 
color-coded and easy to manage. Each task is assignable to separate fields or animals and completely dynamic. 
Users can also take notes and assign them to fields. To make UI user-friendly, the application automatically detects 
users' path and auto-fills features when the user wants to edit anything. The application can also give weather 
forecasts. The weather is displayed on the main screen but can be also viewed in detail. Users can view lots of 
different conditions from wind to humidity. Also, they can search weather conditions for different locations too.

The application can work on any Android mobile phone with an internet connection. All of the data from the user is 
stored in Google Firebase Database and it allows users to access their data without any restrictions. Users can 
modify, remove or add any feature to any of the fields they created. Any changes will be updated in the database 
and none of the information stays in local storage. This allows users to access their data from any phone they are 
logged in. The data is stored separately for each user account. Users can log in to the same account and work 
together if they want to. This allows for better teamwork and job management.
